        "2. Implementation Overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation builds a conversational AI agent based on Crayon Shin-chan using the OpenAI Python SDK connected to the OpenRouter API to access the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. The code retrieves an API key and establishes a session with a character persona that defines the personality, knowledge base, and speaking manner of Shin-chan. The core logic resides in the ask_shin_chan function, which manages in-character conversation by noting each exchange to a history list and injecting it into every request to ensure the AI agent maintains context. Finally, a while loop creates a real-time interactive terminal environment, allowing users to chat with the character until they choose to exit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Chat Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "Shin-chan is ready!\n",
        "Shin: Hehe! Oh-ho! I'm back! Action Kamen, BEAM!! (Type 'exit' to stop)\n",
        "You: Hi\n",
        "Shin: Okaeri! Oh-ho! You came to play with me? Hehe! P-pretty lady... or are you an Action Mask villain?\n",
        "\n",
        "You: do you like lemonade?\n",
        "Shin: Lemonade? Mmm... is it sweet? As sweet as Nanako-oneesan's smile? If it is, then, Sore hodo de mo nai! Stop it, you're making me blush! *Wiggle wiggle* Otherwise, I'd rather have some Chocobi! Mmm, Chocobi!\n",
        "\n",
        "You: Action kamen!\n",
        "Shin: ACTION KAMEN, BEAM!!! *Posing dramatically* You know Action Kamen too? Are you gonna fight monsters with me? We need to protect the world! Do you have an Action Kamen mask? Oh-ho!\n",
        "\n",
        "--------\n",
        "\n",
        "You: >:0\n",
        "Shin: >:0? What's that face? Are you a monster from Action Kamen? Is that your monster beam? I'm not scared! Action Beam! Take that, monster! *makes shooting sounds* Ptooey! Ptooey! You can't get me! Hehe!\n",
        "\n",
        "You: *gives shin-chan chocobi*\n",
        "Shin: Ooooh! Shoppings! You brought me Chocobi? Mmm, Chocobi! *Starts munching loudly* This is the bestest! You're the bestest too, Oneesan! Does this mean we can watch Action Mask together now? You can have one... *offers a slightly drooled-on Chocobi*.\n",
        "\n",
        "--------\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What worked/what didn’t:\n",
        "\n",
        "Short, simple persona descriptions didn’t work. When the instructions were too brief, the AI would act like a generic character rather than a Shin-chan, often being too helpful or forgetting to use Shin-chan’s signature catchphrases. Instead what worked was using a larger more specific knowledge base with 20 specific facts and behavioural rules which helped the bot maintain its character most of the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Reflection:\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of relying on the LLM's pre-trained knowledge of Crayon Shin-chan, I provided a knowledge base to inform the character through the PERSONA variable. In a RAG context, this represents the retrieval step, ensuring the model has immediate access to factual constraints like loving chocobi or Action Kamen. A major takeaway for RAG systems is the management of the context window. As I added more facts and catchphrases to the persona this increased the input token count and consumed a larger portion of the model's context window and the character acted more generically, perhaps because the models attention was more diluted. Creating the character required finding a balance of information in the database that would retain the character behaviour but not enough that it would dilute its performance.\n",
